            A current flaw of the class is that just like the fully connected layer there is a need to specify the exact size of the input,
            this is usually not a problem as long as a few basic rules are kept in mind.
            The convolutional layer has it currently exists always pads th input, has no stride parameter and does not support pooling.
            This means that value of "input" does not change for successive convolutional layers
            The output_channels for one convolutional layer is always the input_channels for the next

            A goal is for the Network class to become powerful and versatile enough to create various legendary neural nets like LeNet 5 and AlexNet

            Better customisability will be added later on

            Thus far, the Convolutional class has only been built and tested on the philosophy of kernels having odd number sizes for each dimensions
            so it could break if a kerenel_size of (4, 4) is used

            Finally, since there is no reverse of the Flatten class, a convolutional layer can never come after a Fully connected layer.
            It is dubious if there will be any significance to a structure that allows convolutional layers to come after fully connected ones but
            the option is sure to be added eventually.

# Final thoughts
# In addition to the issues listed throughout the inline comments,
# there is probably a need to restructure the classes
# Having base classes for Layers, Costs, and Activations that have predefined methods and can be inherited from will be useful
# Having subsequent layers infer redundant parameters will also be useful
# It could also help to put trailer layers in the Network class as attributes as this is the more standard doubly-linked list format and can definitely help
